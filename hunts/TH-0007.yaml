hypothesis: An adversary can observe and collect data on the network using SMB shares with poor permissions.

   Recent Ransomware crews have been exfiltrating huge amounts of data and holding it ransom. SMB usage is a common trait ransomware.
   Scanning your environment for open network shares is an easy way to assess what either a malicious insider

      Using Nmap & PowerView â€“ generate a custom dataset.
      	1. Get list of reachable hosts with SMB open
            - nmap -vv -Pn -n -p 445 <IP Range> -oA smb_host
            - grep open smb_host.gnmap | awk {'print $2'} > smb_up.txt && cat smb_up.txt
        2. Find shares that you have access to (using a modded Powerview see here)
            - Invoke-ShareFinder -HostList smb_up.txt -NoPing -CheckShareAccess | Out-File -Encoding ascii found_shares.txt
        3. Find files in shares that have potentially interesting names
            - Invoke-FileFinder -ShareList found_shares.txt -Terms password,secret,confidential -OutFile results.csv -Verbose

   Test access to shares using `Get-Acl`

   List of open shares with low permissions
   Highlight key findings such as password or confidential files
